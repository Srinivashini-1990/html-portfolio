<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />
<p>Hi! I'm a software engineer with a solid foundation in the IT industry and a 
   renewed passion for building smart, user-focused digital solutions.</p>

<p>I started my career with a B.Tech in Information Technology and 
   spent 5 years working in Accenture as a .Net Developer, where I contributed to Telecom domain projects. After a fulfilling and intentional career break 
   of 7.5 years, I’m now stepping back into the tech world—refreshed, re-skilled, and ready to create impact.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, I’ve been actively updating my skills in Python and full stack development,
   building personal projects, and reconnecting with the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

<p>I bring not only technical expertise but also the resilience, perspective, and adaptability gained 
   from my unique journey. I believe this combination makes me a stronger, more intentional contributor 
   to any team or project.</p>
